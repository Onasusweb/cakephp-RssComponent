<h1>RssComponent for CakePHP 2.x</h1>
<hr/>
<p>This component allows you to read (external) RSS feeds and use their data in your own application.
For example, if you would like to show the latest news of a site that is of interest to your audience,
you can use this component to fetch the latest articles of their feed to publish in your app.</p>

<h2>CODE EXAMPLE</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Implement the component into your controller by using:</li>
    <pre>public $components = array('Rss');</pre>
    <li>Call the component in your controller, to fetch the items from an RSS feed. For example if you want to set the $news array, containing the contents.</li>
<pre lang="PHP">
public function beforeRender() {
  try {
    $newsItems = $this->Rss->read('http://example.com/feed');
  } catch(InternalErrorException $e) {
    $newsItems = null;
  }
  
  $this->set('news', $newsItems);
}
</pre>
</ol>

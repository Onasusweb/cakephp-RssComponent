RssComponent for CakePHP 2.x
---

This component allows you to read (external) RSS feeds and use their data in your own application.
For example, if you would like to show the latest news of a site that is of interest to your audience,
you can use this component to fetch the latest articles of their feed to publish in your app.


CODE EXAMPLE:

1. Implement the component into your controller by using:

	public $components = array('Rss');

2. Call the component in your controller, to fetch the items from an RSS feed. For example if you want to set the $news array, containing the contents:

    public function beforeRender() {
        try {
            $newsItems = $this->Rss->read('http://example.com/feed');
        } catch(InternalErrorException $e) {
            $newsItems = null;
        }
     
        $this->set('news', $newsItems);
    }
